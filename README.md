All of my work done in go, that I remember to put here.



//////////Personal notes for importing non core libraries////////////
Create directory to hold main project file, mod file, sum file
Navigate to directory via cli
go mod init modulename
go get github.somemodule
Then create main file in directory
import github.somemodule
done
